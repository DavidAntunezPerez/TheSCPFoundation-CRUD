# TheSCPFoundation-CRUD
A CRUD about The SCP Foundation made with Java, SQL, HTML, CSS and JS. 

To get into context, The SCP Foundation ("**Secure, Contain and Protect**") is a **fictional secret organization** documented by the collaborative writing wiki project of the same name. The foundation is responsible for **capturing and containing** various paranormal, supernatural, and other mysterious phenomena unexplained by mainstream science (known as "**anomalies**" or "**SCPs**"), while also **keeping their existence hidden from the rest of global human society**.
Many people contribute in social media with different stories about the SCP Foundation and their different anomalies, creating unique, science-fiction and horror stories connected into the same universe.

So what i wanted to do is giving them a place to **add, delete or modify their own stories**, all in the same website using this CRUD.
